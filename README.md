# RubyAppMaster

## Project Structure

This is a basic Ruby application with organized folders for models, controllers, views, and utilities.

### Folder Breakdown:
- **models**: Contains Ruby classes representing data and business logic (e.g., `User`).
- **controllers**: Manages the flow of data and communication between models and views (e.g., `ApplicationController`).
- **views**: Handles user-facing output and displays (e.g., `HomeView`).
- **lib**: Includes utility modules (e.g., `Utility` for helper methods).
- **config**: Configuration and setup files for the app.

### Core Files:
- `main.rb`: The main entry point that starts the application and integrates the components.
- `user.rb`: A simple user model that contains user information and behavior.
- `home_view.rb`: A view that displays a welcome message to the user.
- `utility.rb`: A helper module that provides utility functions like sum and difference.
- `application.rb`: Configuration for setting up the application.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Ruby installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the project.
3. Run `ruby main.rb` to execute the application.

## Features
- User management: Creates a user with a name and email.
- Utility functions: Calculate sum and difference of two numbers.
- Display: Outputs a welcome message and user details.
